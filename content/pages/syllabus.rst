Course Description
==================

| University of California, Davis
| Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering
| Vehicle Stability - EME 134
| 2020 Spring, Lecture: MWF 11:00-11:50 AM, Lab: F 12:10-3:00 PM
| CRN: 63533

------------------

The world contains a variety of vehicles that transport people and goods for
commerce, recreation, and exploration. Vehicles are designed to move through
various environments (land, air, and sea) in efficient, safe, optimal, and
performant manners. The motion of a vehicle is governed by the mechanism in
which forces are applied to the vehicle by the environment and vice versa. The
interaction forces are a function of the vehicle's design and the travel
medium. To understand these phenomena engineers often turn to mathematical
models capable of predicting the observed motion. Two very common concerns for
vehicle designers are 1) whether a vehicle will ever become unstable and 2)
whether it is reasonably easy to control given the design choices.

In this class, you will explore the dynamics of a number of different types of
vehicles by developing and exercising simple mathematical models. You will also
connect this mathematical exploration to interactive experimental
demonstrations of many of the vehicles. Both will provide insight about the
design of vehicles for good performance and handling. When complete, you will
be able to model vehicles, analyze their behavior, identify common design
issues, and make decisions about design with respect to vehicle dynamics.

Learning Objectives
-------------------

After completing the course students will be able to:

- create simple mathematical models of a variety of vehicles
- identify when vehicles are stable/unstable
- identify parameters that affect stability
- describe typical modes of motion for various vehicles
- utilize simulations of vehicles for design purposes
- analyze vehicle motion for desirable characteristics
- apply simple automatic control to stabilize vehicles

Academic Integrity
==================

Academic dishonesty will not be tolerated. Please visit the `Academic Integrity
web page <http://sja.ucdavis.edu/academic-integrity.html>`_ from UC Davis
Office of Student Judicial Affairs to review the campus' policy on academic
responsibility and integrity and read the UC Davis `code of academic conduct
<http://sja.ucdavis.edu/cac.html>`_.

**Under the coronavirus related remote teaching and learning, you are still
expected to uphold the UC Davis Code of Academic Conduct and any suspected
violations will be immediately reported to the SJA for investigation.**

Feel free to discuss homework assignments and work on them together, but each
student must turn in a *unique* solution. Each student will turn in an
individual report for Lab 1 and you will be assigned a Lab partner for Labs
2-5. You may discuss and work on labs together with other students but each lab
report must be a *unique* solution. You may discuss and help each other on your
project but each project report must be a *unique*.

Textbook
========

We will use the following book as the official and required textbook:

   *Vehicle Dynamics, Stability, and Control*, Dean Karnopp, 2nd Edition, CRC Press.
   ISBN 978-1-4665-6085-7 [`Book Information`_]

The book is available via the Canvas Bookshelf page. **You will need to opt-out
if you don't want to be charged for the digital book.**

The first edition of the book, titled "Vehicle Stability" is likely sufficient
but the problem sets will not necessarily match. You will find an errata for
the latest book on Canvas "Files". We will also provide you with free online
resources and other supplementary materials.

Assignments & Grades
====================

Grades will be available in the canvas.ucdavis.edu_ grade book periodically
throughout the course along with class statistics. The Canvas projected final
grades should be considered estimates. Check the website on a regular basis to
gauge your performance. Keep in mind that **15% is deducted per business day
late** on all assignments.

Homework
   Weekly homework based mostly on textbook problems will be assigned which
   will be due before class the following week. Homework will be assessed using
   a rubric tied to the learning objectives. You will receive a "little or no
   effort", "needs improvement", "meets expectations" for each objective. You
   may turn in your homework a second time and any "needs improvements" can be
   raised to "meets expectations". You cannot resubmit your homework if you
   received a "little or no effort" on any item.
Labs
   Computational assignments will be due approximately every other week.
   Students will be in groups of two and will submit a lab report detailing
   their methods, analyses, and results.
Project
   Each lab group will develop a unique project on a topic of their choosing.
   Two written reports detailing research, methods, analyses, and results will
   be used to assess the learning objectives of the project.

Canvas
======

We will make use of Canvas for the course. Log in to canvas.ucdavis.edu_ with
your Kerberos ID and passphrase then select **EME 134 001 SQ 2020**.

We will be using several features in canvas:

Announcements
   This will be my primary communication avenue to you. These announcements
   will be forwarded automatically to your UCD email address. You are expected
   to read these either through your email program or on the Canvas website.
Assignments
   Any electronic assignments will be distributed and collected here.
Bookshelf
   Access to your digital copy of the book.
Discussions
   Forum to ask and answer questions.
Grades
   Your grades and basic stats on your relative performance will be available
   as the course goes along.
Files
   Copyrighted and private files, documents, and other resources will be
   available here for download. The rest will be available for download on this
   website.
Zoom
   Meeting information for the virtual lectures and lab/discussion sections.

Communications
==============

Instructor announcements
------------------------

Electronic announcements from the instructors to the whole class will be made
through Canvas. By default, Canvas will automatically sends the announcement to
your UCD email address. You can change your Canvas settings to opt out, send it
to a different email, or as an SMS. You are responsible for reading the
announcements made via canvas.

Lectures
--------

Lectures, labs, and office hours will be delivered live through a video
conferencing service, e.g. Zoom, at the appointed lecture times. The lectures
will be recorded and the videos will be shared via Canvas as soon as they are
processed. Students should attend the live lectures if at all possible but
attendance is not required due to the extenuating circumstances. Contact the
instructors ASAP if you have any factors that may limit your participation via
video conferencing. **Beware that your participation in the lectures will be
recorded and shared with the others taking course.**

Canvas Discussions
------------------

All asynchronous questions should be asked via Canvas Discussions unless they
are of a personal nature (see email below). Canvas discussions should be used
for all questions about the class, homework, theory, projects, etc that is not
of a private nature. This allows both the instructors and students to
collectively answer questions for the whole class's benefit.

Email
-----

Personal electronic correspondence to the instructors should be made by email.

Accomodation
============

The primary instructor should be informed of any learning accommodations at
least 1 full week before the desired accommodation is needed. I expect students
to contact me to discuss any special arrangements with 1 week time to make and
agree on the arrangements.
