<p>The world contains a variety of vehicles that transport people and goods for
commerce, recreation, and exploration. Vehicles are designed to move through
various environments (land, air, and sea) in efficient, safe, optimal, and
performant manners. The motion of a vehicle is governed by the mechanism in
which forces are applied to the vehicle by the environment and vice versa. The
interaction forces are a function of the vehicle's design and the travel
medium. To understand these phenomena engineers often turn to mathematical
models capable of predicting the observed motion. Two very common concerns for
vehicle designers are 1) whether a vehicle will ever become unstable and 2)
whether it is reasonably easy to control given the design choices.</p>
<p>In this class, you will explore the dynamics of a number of different types of
vehicles by developing and exercising simple mathematical models. You will also
connect this mathematical exploration to interactive experimental
demonstrations of many of the vehicles. Both will provide insight about the
design of vehicles for good performance and handling. When complete, you will
be able to model vehicles, analyze their behavior, identify common design
issues, and make decisions about design with respect to vehicle dynamics.</p>
<div class="section" id="learning-objectives">

<p><strong>If you have any conflicts with the schedule you must tell me in the first
week of class (emergencies will be the only exception).</strong></p>

checking his <a class="reference external" href="http://www.moorepants.info/work-calendar.html">work calendar</a> and select a free time between 8:00 AM and 6:30
PM Monday-Friday. Send him an email requesting an appointment at the suggested
meeting times at least a day in advance. You can also email the teaching

<div class="section" id="academic-integrity">
<h2>Academic Integrity</h2>
<p>Academic dishonesty will not be tolerated. Please visit the <a class="reference external" href="http://sja.ucdavis.edu/academic-integrity.html">Academic Integrity
web page</a> from UC Davis
Office of Student Judicial Affairs to review the campus' policy on academic
responsibility and integrity and read the UC Davis <a class="reference external" href="http://sja.ucdavis.edu/cac.html">code of academic conduct</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Under the coronavirus related remote teaching and learning, you are still
expected to uphold the UC Davis Code of Academic Conduct and any suspected
violations will be immediately reported to the SJA for investigation.</strong></p>
<p>Feel free to discuss homework assignments and work on them together, but each
student must turn in a <em>unique</em> solution. Each student will turn in an
individual report for Lab 1 and you will be assigned a Lab partner for Labs
2-5. You may discuss and work on labs together with other students but each lab
report must be a <em>unique</em> solution. You may discuss and help each other on your
project but each project report must be a <em>unique</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="textbook">
<h2>Textbook</h2>
<p>We will use the following book as the official and required textbook:</p>
<blockquote>
<em>Vehicle Dynamics, Stability, and Control</em>, Dean Karnopp, 2nd Edition, CRC Press.
ISBN 978-1-4665-6085-7 [<a class="reference external" href="https://www.crcpress.com/Vehicle-Dynamics-Stability-and-Control-Second-Edition/Karnopp/p/book/9781466560857">Book Information</a>]</blockquote>
<p>The book is available via the Canvas Bookshelf page. <strong>You will need to opt-out
if you don't want to be charged for the digital book.</strong></p>
<p>The first edition of the book, titled &quot;Vehicle Stability&quot; is likely sufficient
but the problem sets will not necessarily match. You will find an errata for
the latest book on Canvas &quot;Files&quot;. We will also provide you with free online
resources and other supplementary materials.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="assignments-grades">
<h2>Assignments &amp; Grades</h2>
<p>Grades will be available in the <a class="reference external" href="http://canvas.ucdavis.edu">canvas.ucdavis.edu</a> grade book periodically
throughout the course along with class statistics. The Canvas projected final
grades should be considered estimates. Check the website on a regular basis to
gauge your performance. Keep in mind that <strong>15% is deducted per business day
late</strong> on all assignments.</p>

<dt>Homework</dt>
<dd>Weekly homework, based mostly on textbook problems, will be assigned and be
due before class the following week. Homework will be assessed using a
rubric tied to the learning objectives. You will receive a &quot;little or no
effort&quot;, &quot;needs improvement&quot;, &quot;meets expectations&quot; for each objective. You
may turn in your homework a second time and any &quot;needs improvements&quot; can be
raised to &quot;meets expectations&quot;. You cannot resubmit your homework if you
received a &quot;little or no effort&quot; on any item. The lowest homework grade will
be dropped.</dd>
<dt>Labs</dt>
<dd>Computational assignments will be due approximately every other week.
Students will be in groups of two and will submit a lab report detailing
their methods, analyses, and results.</dd>
<dt>Project</dt>
<dd>Each lab group will develop a unique project on a topic of their choosing.
Two written reports detailing research, methods, analyses, and results will

<h2>Communications</h2>
<div class="section" id="instructor-announcements">
<h3>Instructor announcements</h3>
<p>Electronic announcements from the instructors to the whole class will be made
through Canvas. By default, Canvas will automatically sends the announcement to
your UCD email address. You can change your Canvas settings to opt out, send it
to a different email, or as an SMS. You are responsible for reading the
announcements made via canvas.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="lectures">
<h3>Lectures</h3>
<p>Lectures, labs, and office hours will be delivered live through a video
conferencing service, e.g. Zoom, at the appointed lecture times. The lectures
will be recorded and the videos will be shared via Canvas as soon as they are
processed. Students should attend the live lectures if at all possible but
attendance is not required due to the extenuating circumstances. Contact the
instructors ASAP if you have any factors that may limit your participation via
video conferencing. <strong>Beware that your participation in the lectures will be
recorded and shared with the others taking course.</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="canvas-discussions">
<h3>Canvas Discussions</h3>
<p>All asynchronous questions should be asked via Canvas Discussions unless they
are of a personal nature (see email below). Canvas discussions should be used
for all questions about the class, homework, theory, projects, etc that is not
of a private nature. This allows both the instructors and students to
collectively answer questions for the whole class's benefit.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="slack">
<h3>Slack</h3>
<p>Make an account with your UCD email address here:</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://ucdavis.slack.com/">https://ucdavis.slack.com/</a></p>
<p>Once you have an account you can ask the instructor to add you to the channel.</p>
<p>The primary purpose of this channel is for you all to have a way to discuss and
help each other with the assignments and to have a way to communicate with your
class mates on matter regarding the course. The UCD Principles of Community and
Code of Academic Conduct apply for the communication in the Slack channel.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="email">
<h3>Email</h3>
<p>Personal electronic correspondence to the instructors should be made by email.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="accomodation">
<h2>Accomodation</h2>
<p>The primary instructor should be informed of any learning accommodations at
least 1 full week before the desired accommodation is needed. I expect students
to contact me to discuss any special arrangements with 1 week time to make and
agree on the arrangements.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="student-campus-resources">
<h2>Student Campus Resources</h2>
<p>This is a helpful page for students' frequently asked questions:</p>
